幻惑の対価
Chya don't get it
絶命か GIFT かの脅威
甘んじて受けるか that they tag you with
So go face what's coming and don't ask why
度外視の fake が牽強付会
I'm always getting your back
But now you got to grip the trigger
翻す深紅
Come on! Show me how you think!
繋げ さもなくば低コントラストの善悪
懺悔を吐けば 骰子次第
Just like all the rest?
Go take some cover
Butchya gotta break out to be the brat
Cuz ya tired of being just a copycat
Feel the blues チラつく筋書き乱す飢渇を feedback
Duck and cover
Butchya gotta bite back
This ain't chitchat
Cuz ya tired of being just a copycat
Cuts and bruises 超俗した次元の契約を刻む
Fist emblazoned
Don't pretend to be someone you're not cuz you
feel
攻め込んだ in check なぎ倒した Knight
Today's not the day for you to die
The drifting phantoms 下す采配
Don't pretend to be trapped
You can always appeal
無抵抗に匙を投げる tech はない
So cast all your spells up in the sky
Judge his master 破滅問う原罪
Impersonator!
Chya don't get it
Get dressed and feast upon it
You're not sick of the labels that they tag you
with?
So go face what's coming and don't ask why
You can't sit and fake a headache and cry
I'm always getting your back
But now you got to grip the trigger
Surf or sink
Come on! Show me how you think!
Now get some and be yourself and no backin' out
Now get some, yeah!
And cast the first die!
逆説歪む黎明
Go take some cover
Butchya gotta break out to be the brat
Cuz ya tired of being just a copycat
Feel the blues ギラつく指先散らす未完の feedback
Duck and cover
Butchya gotta bite back
This ain't chitchat
Cuz ya tired of being just a copycat
Cuts and bruises 盲目的悦の真贋
Go take some cover
Butchya gotta break out to be the brat
Cuz ya tired of being just a copycat
Feel the blues チラつく筋書き乱す飢渇を feedback
Duck and cover
Butchya gotta bite back
This ain't chitchat
Cuz ya tired of being just a copycat
Cuts and bruises 超俗した次元の契約を刻む
Fist emblazoned
Don't pretend to be someone you're not cuz you
feel
攻め込んだ in check なぎ倒した Knight
Today's not the day for you to die
The drifting phantoms 下す采配
Don't pretend to be trapped
You can always appeal
無抵抗に匙を投げる tech はない
So cast all your spells up in the sky
Judge his master 破滅問う原罪
